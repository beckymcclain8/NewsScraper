# Good News Scraper

My Good News Scraper uses Cheerio to scrape news articles from https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/.  
The scraped article's title, link, and picture are saved in a Mongo database.  
Handlebars is used to display the scraped information on the page.  
When the user clicks on the "comments" button they are able to leave a comment attached to that specific article.  
The comments are also then saved to MongoDB and can be pulled up later.
